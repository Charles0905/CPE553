You will be given a main() function that you can partially edit and creating a DynamicBitmap class to output an image file.

FOR THIS WEEK, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WRITE ANY OF THE DRAWING METHODS.
same for saving the image. Since we did not cover it, you do not have to.

Just constructor, destructor, copy constructor, operator =.

But all parts of the assignment will be given out for next week since we did not review them so
feel free to do it all if you can.

Instructions:

1. Copy and paste the main() function from hwBitmap.cc (session08).
   https://github.com/StevensDeptECE/CPE553-CPP/blob/master/session08_dynamicmemory/hwBitmap2.cc (Links to an external site.)

2. In the previous assignment you were required to add code to get all colors working.
   Add this code again into the first section of this assignment.

   The second section should not be edited. Make no changes in this section.

3. The Bitmap image does NOT have a set size this time but should handle a potential 
   dynamic input (a given size for now is 1024x1024).
   
   Your DynamicBitmap class will now need to handle this dynamic memory and create 
   these functions:
    1. Constructor (That allocates dynamic memory)
    2. Destructor (Frees the memory, delete [])
    3. Copy Constructor
    4. Operator = (Use either old way or copy and swap)

4. Your code should output to a file with the proper formatting to be read as an image.
   This includes using the stb_image library dicussed in class and saved here: 
   https://github.com/StevensDeptECE/CPE553-CPP/tree/master/imagelib (Links to an external site.)

   For grading, your code will be run to check for compiler errors, then the created 
   image file will be opened for accuracy for the color/position/size of all shapes.
