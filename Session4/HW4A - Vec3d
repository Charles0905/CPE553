1. Copy and paste the main() function from hwVec3d.cc (session04).
   https://github.com/StevensDeptECE/CPE553-CPP/blob/master/session04/hwVec3d.cc (Links to an external site.)
   Do NOT edit the main() function in any way. You will be creating a Vec3d class
   to get this main() function working.

2. The main() function has been separated into several sections:
     Section 1: Create constructor/s to create the Vec3d objects.
     Section 2: Overload the three operators for vector math.
     Section 3: Compute the dot product as a function and as a method.
     Section 4: Create three methods to compute various vector properties.
     Section 5: Overload the << operator to output formatted Vec3d objects.
                Example format: (1.0,2.5,3.5)

3. Things to remember:
     You should always think for each method, "Can I make this method readonly(const)?"
     For each line in main, think "What method would I have to write in the class 
     to make this work?"
 

Example output:

a: (1.0,2.5,3.5)
b: (2,0,0)
c: (2,3.5,0)
