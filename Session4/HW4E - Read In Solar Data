1. Download the solarsystem.dat file in current directory (google drive).

   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwxfq4Y7f7vkNGNwLUszUzBYX1k (Links to an external site.)

   Do not change the file name or file type. Tests will be performed with a variety of different inputs in the solarsystem.dat file.

2. You will read in each line and create a Body object.

   The object will store the name, mass, radius, and position.

   In order to calculate position, choose a distance from the center which is the 
   average of perigee and apogee.

   Compute the position vector as using a random angle and compute 
In order to compute a random number see: randexample.cc in session04



   x = r cos(t), y = r sin(t).

Input file (solarsystem.dat):
The input file (solarsystem.dat) contains information in the following format:

Name Orbits Mass Diam Perihelion Aphelion ...etc
Sun NaN 1.9891e30 1.391684e9 0 0
Mercury Sun 0.330e24 4.879e6 4.6e10 6.98e10

Dralo Sun 5.22e26 1.4336e6 3.055e12 3.294e12
... etc

Names of planets will not necessarily be real, and the amount of planets may vary.
Therefore, please read in planets until the end of file.

Output:

Your output should be in the following format for each body:

Name Mass Radius Position
Place each body on a separate line.
