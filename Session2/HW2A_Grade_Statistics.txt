You will be creating a program that reads in a file named "grades2.txt" that is formatted as follows:

      N
      grade0 grade1 ... gradeN
      Where N is the number of space-delimited, floating-point values on the following line.

Your program will produce the following statistics:
1) Min
2) Max
3) Average
4) Standard Deviation

You may assume all input will be properly formatted and that there is a newline ('\n') at the end of the file. 

Output Format
The program will print the min, max, average, and standard deviation, in that order, each on a newline WITHOUT any extra information.  
For example:
        ~/> ./a.out
        12.6
        100.0
        82.95
        3.786
 

Implementation Details
Your program should use the template provided in class (03bfiles.cc).  It should read values into an array as well as use references when passing mutable variables.
This is C++ class, so please use C++ utils/features to do file reading and handling.  This means do NOT use fopen, fread, etc.
